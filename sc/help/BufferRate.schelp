class:: BufferRate 
summary:: Buffer rate utility class 
categories::  UGens>Buffer


Description::
Allows changing the buffer rate after creating it

classmethods::

method:: kr

argument:: bufnum

The number to change the rate for

argument:: trigger

Rate change occurs on trigger

argument:: samplerate

The new rate for the buffer

argument:: doneAction

The doneAction to perform after a successful trigger, e.g. to free the synth

examples::

One shot use- change the buffer rate to control rate, free the synth

code::
s.boot;
b=Buffer.alloc(s,128);
(
  {
    BufferRate.kr(b, 1, ControlRate.ir, 2);
  }.play;
)
b.updateInfo;
b.sampleRate;          // rate is now 750 (depending on system)
b.write("buf.wav");    // rate of buf.wav is now 750 (depending on system)
::

Keep running and change several times

code::
s.boot;
b=Buffer.alloc(s,128);
(
  x={
    arg t_rate;
    BufferRate.kr(b, t_rate, t_rate);
  }.play;
  x.set(\t_rate, 1000);
  x.set(\t_rate, 2000);
  x.set(\t_rate, 3000);
)

discussion::

Sometimes it is useful to change the rate of a buffer after it was created- with regular SuperCollider tools, this is only possible by performing a read on an existing audio file of a certain rate. Rates differing from server sample rate are well supported, with this UGen they gain some flexibility, for example to record control rate values and then save them with the correct rate in the created file.
